    <div class="text">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis model is of an 13B rotary engine that has been highly used in cars like RX7, RX8 and 787B. The reason for this model is my admiration for Mazda and their ingenuity.<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Wankel engines were invented in 1950s by Felix Wankel, a German engineer. Over the years, displacement has been increased and turbocharging has been added. Mazda rotary engines have a reputation for being relatively small and powerful at the expense of poor fuel efficiency.  </div>
